# 9.1 Entanglement Gravity Detection Scheme in Microwave Cavities

This is the most direct and startling corollary of our theory: **Gravity originates not only from energy, but also from information (entanglement).**

In standard general relativity, gravitational source is energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. If we have two systems with same total energy but different quantum states (e.g., one in thermal equilibrium, another in highly entangled state), standard theory predicts they produce identical gravitational fields.

But in our IGVP theory, gravity is geometric response of spacetime networks to maintain information transmission consistency. Entanglement directly corresponds to density of spacetime connections.

$$G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G (T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{energy}} + T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{entanglement}})$$

## 9.1.1 Experimental Design

**Apparatus**: Construct a high quality factor (High-Q) superconducting microwave cavity, placed in ultra-low temperature environment (shielding thermal noise).

**Control**: Use superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) as nonlinear elements to prepare two types of quantum states in cavity:

* **State A (Low Entanglement)**: Multi-mode coherent states, simulating classical electromagnetic fields.

* **State B (High Entanglement)**: Multi-mode squeezed vacuum states or cluster states.

* **Key Constraint**: Through precise quantum feedback control, ensure **total energy expectation value $\langle H \rangle$** of states A and B are **strictly equal**.

**Detection**: Use a frequency-stabilized laser beam passing through microwave cavity (or close to its surface) as detection arm, forming high-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer.

**Signal**: Measure phase difference $\Delta \phi$ (Shapiro delay) of laser under backgrounds of state A and state B.

## 9.1.2 Theoretical Prediction

* **Standard Physics**: Since energy unchanged, $\Delta \phi_{GR} \approx 0$.

* **QCA Physics**: High entanglement state means higher information processing density $\rho_{\text{info}}$. According to optical metric formula $n \approx 1 + G\rho/c^4$, effective refractive index of state B region will be slightly larger than state A.

   $$\Delta \phi_{QCA} \propto G \cdot (S_B - S_A)$$

   We expect to observe a non-zero phase shift.

If this experiment succeeds, it will be the biggest turning point in physics since Eddington's solar eclipse observation—**it proves information is direct source of gravity.**
