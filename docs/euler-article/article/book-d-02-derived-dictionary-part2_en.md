> This is an English translation of [中文原文](book-d-02-derived-dictionary-part2.md)

## Opening: From Foundation to Advanced

In the previous volume, we understood 12 foundational concepts.

This volume continues deeper, understanding another 12 advanced concepts.

These concepts will help you understand: how to build consensus, how to identify traps, how to maintain resilience, how to measure value.

Let's begin.

## Concept Thirteen | Consensus Sampling: Find Appropriate Alignment Rhythm

**Common Definition**: For teams to maintain consensus, regular "alignment" is needed. Alignment frequency must match the speed of change.

**How to Practice**:
- Things change fast, alignment frequency must be high (like daily).
- Things change slow, alignment frequency can be low (like monthly).
- If alignment frequency is too low, "talking past each other" chaos appears.

**Examples**:
A startup team in sprint phase adjusts strategy daily, so needs daily stand-ups. If they only align once a week, by the time everyone syncs information, the situation has already changed.

**Misconception**: Not everything needs "daily meetings," nor can everything go "a month without contact." The key is matching change speed.

## Concept Fourteen | Metaphor/Symbol: Use Structure to Compress Complexity

**Common Definition**: Good metaphors are not "sounds beautiful," but "preserve core structure, reduce comprehension cost."

**How to Identify**:
- A good metaphor makes people "understand immediately," and doesn't go wrong when "transferring reasoning."
- A bad metaphor sounds very vivid, but leads to errors when reasoning.

**Examples**:
- "Process like flowing water" is a good metaphor because it preserves "continuity," "irreversibility," "directionality" structure.
- "Employees are screws" is a bad metaphor because it reinforces "replaceable," "no initiative" impression, but ignores people's creativity and emotions.

**Misconception**: Don't sacrifice "accuracy" for "vividness." Good metaphors are structural mappings, not surface similarities.

## Concept Fifteen | Filter Bubble: Quantification of Information Cocoon

**Common Definition**: If the information you see differs too much from public information distribution, you're in a "filter bubble."

**How to Identify**:
- Is your information source singular? (Only read certain public accounts, only listen to certain people)
- Are your views extreme? (Differ greatly from mainstream views, and you think "only I'm right")
- Do you reject different voices? (See different opinions and immediately think "they've been brainwashed")

**How to Break**:
- Actively contact information from different sources.
- Listen to arguments of people with opposite views, not just those who agree with you.
- Regularly ask yourself: "If I'm wrong, what evidence would I see?"

**Examples**:
You only discuss investment in a certain small circle, everyone is bullish on a certain asset, you also think "guaranteed profit." But if you step out of the circle, you'll find mainstream views are completely different. Then you must be alert: have you fallen into a "filter bubble"?

## Concept Sixteen | Alignment: Maximize Shared Value Under Constraints

**Common Definition**: "Alignment" is not "abandoning your own position," but "within constraint boundaries, find solutions good for both sides."

**How to Practice**:
1. Clarify both sides' core demands.
2. Find "common interests" and "conflict points."
3. Cooperate on common interests, negotiate on conflict points.

**Examples**:
Company and employee alignment:
- Company wants efficiency, employees want growth and income.
- Common interest: make good product, company has revenue, employees have sense of achievement and bonuses.
- Conflict point: short-term interest (overtime rush work) vs. long-term health (work-life balance).
- Alignment solution: moderate overtime at key nodes, but maintain reasonable rhythm normally, and provide overtime compensation.

**Misconception**: "Alignment" is not "unprincipled compromise," but "seeking win-win within principle boundaries." If both sides' core demands fundamentally conflict, then not suitable for collaboration.

## Concept Seventeen | Explainability: Simplification That Preserves Key Information

**Common Definition**: A decision is "explainable" if you can use simple logic to reproduce more than 80% of decision results.

**How to Test**:
- Can you explain the main basis of the decision in three sentences?
- If changing a certain key factor, does the decision change accordingly? (Causal consistency)
- Can others make similar decisions in similar situations based on your explanation? (Transferability)

**Examples**:
A loan approval system:
- Unexplainable: "AI says this person has good credit, so approve." (Black box)
- Explainable: "This person has stable income, no bad records, low debt ratio, so approve." (Clear logic)

**Misconception**: "Explainable" is not "simple and crude," but "reasonable simplification that preserves key information." Oversimplification loses important details, over-complexity makes no one understand.

## Concept Eighteen | Diagnosis—Treatment—Recovery: Three-Stage Control

**Common Definition**: Problem-solving requires three steps: accurate diagnosis, optimal treatment, continuous recovery.

**How to Practice**:
1. **Diagnosis**: Find the root cause of the problem, don't be fooled by surface phenomena.
2. **Treatment**: Use minimal cost method to solve core problem.
3. **Recovery**: Establish mechanism to prevent problem recurrence.

**Examples**:
A team has low efficiency:
- Diagnosis: Is it a process problem, personnel problem, or unclear goals? Through data and interviews, determine it's "unclear goals."
- Treatment: Realign goals, establish clear priorities.
- Recovery: Establish weekly goal review mechanism, prevent goals from becoming unclear again.

**Misconception**: Most people only do "treatment," don't do "diagnosis" and "recovery." Result is: treat headache when head hurts, treat foot when foot hurts, problems recur.

## Concept Nineteen | Resilience: Maintain Function Under Disturbance

**Common Definition**: "Resilience" is not "not getting hurt," but "recovering quickly after getting hurt."

**How to Establish**:
1. **Redundancy**: Key links have backups, avoid "single point of failure."
2. **Diversity**: Don't put all resources in one basket.
3. **Quick feedback**: Discover problems promptly, adjust promptly.

**Examples**:
A resilient team:
- Key positions have backups, someone leaving doesn't cause project collapse.
- Income sources diversified, a client leaving isn't fatal.
- Weekly review, discover problems promptly, adjust quickly.

**Misconception**: "Resilience" is not "no problems," but "able to withstand after problems." Excessive pursuit of "zero risk" actually makes systems fragile (because no redundancy, no response experience).

## Concept Twenty | Value and Price: Net Effect and Marginal Cost

**Common Definition**:
- **Value**: The real meaning of something to you, considering benefits and costs.
- **Price**: Market tag, or marginal cost you pay for it.

**How to Calculate**:
Value = Expected benefit - Cost × Shadow scale

**Examples**:
You're deciding whether to get an MBA:
- Expected benefit: Knowledge, connections, career opportunities.
- Cost: Tuition, time, opportunity cost (these two years you could do other things).
- Shadow scale: Your marginal value of time and money (for someone earning 10k/month vs. 100k/month, same tuition has different cost).

Only when "expected benefit > cost × shadow scale" is getting an MBA worthwhile.

**Misconception**: Don't only look at "price," but at "value." Some things are expensive but have higher value, worth investing; some things are cheap but waste time, not worth doing.

## Concept Twenty-One | Learning—Memory—Forgetting: Knowledge Lifecycle

**Common Definition**:
- **Learning**: Acquire new information, test error decreases.
- **Memory**: Information in your "stable subspace," can be retrieved anytime.
- **Forgetting**: Infrequently used information gradually decays, eventually can't be retrieved.

**How to Combat Forgetting**:
- Spaced repetition: Don't learn all at once, but distribute over time, each review interval gradually lengthens.
- Retrieval practice: Don't just read, but actively recall, apply.
- Establish connections: Connect new knowledge with existing knowledge, form network.

**Examples**:
Learning English words:
- Wrong method: Memorize 100 in one day, forget 80 the next day.
- Right method: Memorize 20 on first day, review on third day, review again on seventh day, intervals gradually lengthen. Each review try to make sentences with these words (retrieval practice).

**Misconception**: "Learn fast" doesn't equal "remember well." Learn slowly, practice repeatedly, seems slow, actually more efficient.

## Concept Twenty-Two | Risk and Defense: Antifragility and Robustness

**Common Definition**:
- **Risk**: Potential loss brought by uncertainty.
- **Defense**: Measures to reduce risk.
- **Antifragility**: Within a certain range of pressure, actually becomes stronger.

**How to Establish**:
1. **Identify risks**: List places that might go wrong, assess probability and impact.
2. **Establish buffers**: Key resources have margins, don't run at full capacity.
3. **Stress test**: Actively apply small pressure to system, test if it can withstand.

**Examples**:
Personal finance antifragility:
- Don't invest all money in high-risk assets, keep some cash and low-risk assets as buffer.
- Regularly review expenses, if income suddenly drops, know which expenses can be cut.
- Actively reduce living costs for one month, experience "minimalist life," test your endurance.

**Misconception**: "Defense" is not "no risk-taking," but "taking bearable risks." Completely no risk-taking means no growth; taking excessive risks means one failure brings total ruin.

## Concept Twenty-Three | Ethical Net Increase: Quantifiable Definition of Good and Evil

**Common Definition**:
- **Good**: Under conservation budget, stability net increase (benefit > cost).
- **Evil**: Under conservation budget, stability net decrease (benefit < cost).

**How to Quantify**:
Net increase = Stability improvement - Cost × Shadow scale

**Examples**:
An enterprise decision:
- Improve employee benefits (increase team stability), but costs rise.
- If "stability improvement" brings long-term benefits (reduce turnover, improve efficiency) greater than "cost rise," this is "good."
- If it's just "face project," employee actual feeling doesn't improve, but costs greatly increase, that's "evil."

**Misconception**: "Good" is not "doing good at any cost," but "within bearable range, make system more stable." Unaffordable "good" often isn't sustainable.

## Concept Twenty-Four | Governance Four-Piece Set: Transparency—Mirror-Test—Three-Corrections—Closed-Loop

**Common Definition**: Governance's minimum executable closed loop:
1. **Transparency**: Make window and scale public, let everyone know what standard you're using.
2. **Mirror-Test**: Key decisions must pass "role swap" test, ensure fairness.
3. **Three-Corrections**: Eliminate aliasing, insufficient correction, tail neglect three types of errors.
4. **Closed-Loop**: Break decisions into five-minute actions, ensure execution.

**How to Practice**:
For each major decision:
- Make public your information sources and judgment standards.
- Do a "mirror-test": If I were the affected person, could I accept?
- Do "three-corrections": Check three types of structural errors.
- Break down into specific actions, five minutes per step, ensure implementation.

**Examples**:
A team adjusting performance assessment:
- Transparency: Announce new assessment standards and weights in advance.
- Mirror-Test: Managers imagine being employees, can they accept this standard?
- Three-Corrections: Have we confused "effort" with "results"? Ignored team collaboration? Considered extreme cases (like someone getting sick)?
- Closed-Loop: First week, communicate new standards one-on-one with everyone; second week, pilot run and collect feedback; third week, fine-tune and formally implement.

**Misconception**: "Governance" is not "control," but "making system self-operate more stably." Good governance reduces chaos, increases certainty, benefits everyone.
