## The Puzzles of Physics

Imagine you are a detective investigating a complex case. You have many clues:

- 📍 **Clue A (General Relativity)**: Tells you gravity is the curvature of spacetime
- 📍 **Clue B (Quantum Mechanics)**: Tells you the microscopic world is probabilistic
- 📍 **Clue C (Thermodynamics)**: Tells you time has a direction, entropy always increases
- 📍 **Clue D (Information Theory)**: Tells you information is physical
- 📍 **Clue E (Cosmology)**: Tells you the universe is expanding

Each clue seems reasonable, but when you try to piece them together, you find they contradict each other:

### Puzzle 1: Conflict Between Gravity and Quantum Mechanics

**General Relativity** says: Spacetime is smooth, continuous, deterministic. Like a smooth rubber membrane.

**Quantum Mechanics** says: Everything is discrete, jumping, probabilistic. Like flickering pixels.

> **Question**: At the center of a black hole, or at the moment of the Big Bang, gravity is extremely strong and scales are extremely small—both theories apply. But they give completely different answers. It's like two witnesses giving completely contradictory descriptions of the same event. Who is right?

### Puzzle 2: Multiple Faces of Time

**Relativity** says: Time is relative. If you move fast in a spaceship, time passes slowly. Time is part of geometry.

**Quantum Mechanics** says: Time is an absolute external parameter. The $t$ in the Schrödinger equation is a globally unified clock.

**Thermodynamics** says: Time has an arrow. An egg can break, but a broken egg won't reassemble itself.

> **Question**: What is time really? Is it geometry, a parameter, or an arrow? Or are all three, and we just haven't found a way to unify them?

### Puzzle 3: Mysterious Connection Between Entropy and Gravity

**In the 1970s**, physicists Bekenstein and Hawking discovered: Black holes have temperature and entropy. Moreover, a black hole's entropy is proportional to its **surface area**, not volume.

$$
S_{\text{BH}} = \frac{A}{4G\hbar}
$$

This is very strange. Usually, entropy should be proportional to volume (the larger the room, the more possibilities for disorder). But black hole entropy is proportional to surface area, as if all information is encoded on the surface.

> **Question**: Why is entropy related to area? Why are gravity (geometry) and information (entropy) entangled? Is there a deeper connection between them?

### Puzzle 4: Why Does the Universe Follow These Laws?

We have Einstein's equations, Yang-Mills equations, Dirac equations... These equations are all very successful and can precisely predict experimental results.

But, **why does the universe follow these equations?**

Is it because they are "laws of nature"? But who made these laws? Why these laws and not others?

> **Question**: Is there a deeper reason that makes these laws not "made" but **necessarily emergent**?

## The Dream of Unification

Physicists have always dreamed of finding a "Theory of Everything" that can unify all these fragmented theories.

### Historical Unification Achievements

Humanity has had several great unifications:

1. **Newton (17th century)**: Unified planetary motion in the heavens and apple falling on earth
   - Before: Heaven and earth were two worlds, following different laws
   - After: The same universal gravitation law

2. **Maxwell (19th century)**: Unified electricity and magnetism
   - Before: Electrical and magnetic phenomena seemed like two different things
   - After: The same set of Maxwell equations, light is electromagnetic waves

3. **Einstein (20th century)**: Unified time and space
   - Before: Time was time, space was space
   - After: Spacetime is a whole, can be curved

4. **Weinberg-Salam-Glashow (20th century)**: Unified electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces
   - Before: Two different forces
   - After: The same electroweak unified theory

Each unification brought profound insights and new technologies.

### Current Attempts

Now, physicists are trying to unify gravity and quantum mechanics. Main candidate theories include:

- **String Theory**: Believes fundamental particles are tiny vibrating strings
- **Loop Quantum Gravity**: Believes spacetime itself is a discrete network
- **Causal Dynamical Triangulation**: Uses simple triangles to piece together spacetime

But these theories all face challenges: either the mathematics is too complex, lack experimental evidence, or cannot give clear predictions.

## What Makes GLS Theory Different

GLS unified theory takes a **completely different path**.

### Not Seeking "New Symmetries"

Traditional unified theories usually seek a **larger symmetry group**. For example:

- Electromagnetic + Weak → Electroweak unification → $SU(2) \times U(1)$ symmetry
- Strong + Electroweak → Grand unification → $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$ symmetry

This approach is: find a larger "parent group" and make all known forces its "subgroups."

But GLS theory says: **The problem is not symmetry, but our understanding of fundamental concepts**.

### Unifying "Ontology," Not "Symmetry"

The core insight of GLS theory is:

> **Time, causality, geometry, information—they are not four independent concepts, but four projections of the same reality.**

Like a cube, viewed from different angles, the projections are different shapes:

- Viewed from the front, it's a square
- Viewed from the side, it's also a square
- Viewed from above at an angle, it's a hexagon

But there is only one cube.

Similarly:

- **Scattering theory** sees: S-matrix, phase, delay time
- **Geometric theory** sees: metric, curvature, geodesics
- **Information theory** sees: entropy, relative entropy, Fisher metric
- **Causal theory** sees: partial order, diamonds, Markov property

But **they describe the same thing**.

### Core Formula: Unified Time Scale Identity

The core of GLS theory is an equation that looks simple but has profound meaning:

$$
\kappa(\omega) = \frac{\varphi'(\omega)}{\pi} = \rho_{\text{rel}}(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\text{tr}\,Q(\omega)
$$

This equation says:

- $\kappa(\omega)$: **Scattering time delay** (how long a particle is delayed after scattering)
- $\varphi'(\omega)/\pi$: **Phase derivative** (rate of change of quantum phase)
- $\rho_{\text{rel}}(\omega)$: **Relative density of states** (density of energy levels)
- $\text{tr}\,Q(\omega)/2\pi$: **Wigner-Smith group delay** (total delay of all scattering channels)

**Four seemingly completely different physical quantities are actually the same thing!**

This is as shocking as discovering "speed of light = electric field speed = magnetic field speed = electromagnetic wave speed."

## The Promise of the Theory

If this unification is correct, what will it bring?

### 1. Deriving Gravity from Entropy

No need to assume Einstein's equations. Only one principle is needed: **Generalized entropy on small causal diamonds takes extremum**.

Then, Einstein's equation $G_{ab} + \Lambda g_{ab} = 8\pi G T_{ab}$ automatically emerges.

> **Analogy**: Just as soap bubbles automatically form spheres (minimum surface area), the gravity equation is a natural result of entropy extremum.

### 2. Unifying All Physical Laws

No need to separately assume:

- Law of gravity (Einstein's equations)
- Quantum field theory (Yang-Mills equations)
- Matter equations (Dirac equations)
- Macroscopic laws (Navier-Stokes equations)

Only one principle is needed: **The universe must be self-consistent**.

All these equations are expansions of the same "universe consistency variational principle" at different levels.

$$
\delta \mathcal{I}[\mathfrak{U}] = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{All Physical Laws}
$$

### 3. Explaining Consciousness and Observers

Traditional physics avoids the "observer" problem, considering it a matter for philosophy or neuroscience.

But GLS theory says: **Observers are part of the physical structure**.

Consciousness is not a mysterious "soul," but a special **self-referential scattering network structure**.

The existence of "I" is equivalent to a causal diamond chain satisfying specific topological constraints.

### 4. Connecting Discrete and Continuous

Is the universe at its deepest level discrete (quantum cellular automaton) or continuous (differential manifold)?

GLS theory says: **Both are different limits of the same structure**.

Discrete $\xrightarrow{\text{continuous limit}}$ Continuous

This is like:

- Pixels dense enough → looks like a smooth image
- Enough atoms → looks like a continuous fluid

## Summary in One Paragraph

Physics faces profound puzzles: gravity and quantum mechanics are incompatible, time has multiple faces, entropy and gravity are mysteriously connected, and we don't know why the universe follows these laws.

GLS unified theory provides a completely new perspective: **Not seeking larger symmetries, but recognizing that time, causality, geometry, and information are four projections of the same reality**.

The core insight is condensed in the **Unified Time Scale Identity**: scattering delay = phase derivative = density of states = group delay.

Starting from this unification, gravity, quantum field theory, cosmology, and even consciousness can all emerge as different levels of the same "universe consistency variational principle."

This is not just theoretical unification, but **ontological unification**: all things share the same source, only projections differ.
