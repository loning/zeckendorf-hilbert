## Reading Strategies

### 📖 First Pass: Quick Browse

**Goal**: Build overall impression, don't aim to understand all details

- ⏱️ Spend 15-20 minutes browsing each article
- 📌 Mark parts you don't understand but are interested in
- ✅ Focus on **analogies** and **core insights**, formulas can be skipped first
- 🎯 Ask yourself: What is the main idea of this article?

### 📖 Second Pass: Deep Understanding

**Goal**: Understand key concepts and argument logic

- ⏱️ Spend 30-60 minutes on each article
- 📌 Try to understand the **physical meaning** of mathematical formulas, not just symbols
- ✅ Compare with diagrams and analogies to build intuition
- 🎯 Ask yourself: Can I explain this concept in my own words?

### 📖 Third Pass: Critical Reading

**Goal**: Question, reflect, integrate

- ⏱️ 1-2 hours per article
- 📌 Ask questions: Is this assumption reasonable? Are there counterexamples?
- ✅ Try to derive key formulas
- 🎯 Ask yourself: What problems does this theory solve? What problems remain unsolved?

## Using Diagrams and Symbols

### Mermaid Flowcharts

This tutorial extensively uses mermaid diagrams to visualize conceptual relationships. For example:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Time["Time"] --> Unity["Unified Scale Identity"]
    Cause["Causality"] --> Unity
    Boundary["Boundary"] --> Unity
    Scatter["Scattering"] --> Unity
    Entropy["Entropy"] --> Unity

    Unity --> IGVP["IGVP<br/>Entropy→Gravity"]
    Unity --> Unified["Unified Time<br/>Scattering=Modular=Geometry"]

    style Unity fill:#ff6b6b,stroke:#c92a2a,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

**How to Read**:

- Boxes: Concepts or theoretical modules
- Arrows: Logical dependencies or derivation directions
- Colors: Highlight key points (usually red or blue)

### Mathematical Formulas

Formulas appear in three forms:

1. **Inline formulas**: Like $E = mc^2$, embedded in text
2. **Standalone formulas**: Separate line, highlighting important equations

$$
G_{ab} + \Lambda g_{ab} = 8\pi G T_{ab}
$$

3. **Formulas with explanations**:

$$
\underbrace{\kappa(\omega)}_{\text{scattering delay}} = \underbrace{\frac{\varphi'(\omega)}{\pi}}_{\text{phase derivative}} = \underbrace{\rho_{\text{rel}}(\omega)}_{\text{density of states}} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2\pi}\text{tr}\,Q(\omega)}_{\text{group delay}}
$$

**Reading Suggestions**:

- First pass: Only read text explanations, understand physical meaning
- Second pass: Look at formula structure, understand symbol relationships
- Third pass: If needed, try to derive

## Learning Suggestions

### ✅ Things to Do

1. **Allow yourself not to understand**
   - Not understanding on the first pass is normal
   - These concepts are profound and need time to digest

2. **Use analogies to build intuition**
   - Every abstract concept has concrete analogies
   - Understand analogies first, then mathematics

3. **Take notes**
   - Summarize key ideas in your own words
   - Draw diagrams, write analogies, ask questions

4. **Skip parts you're not interested in**
   - This tutorial is modular
   - You can read selectively

5. **Re-read key chapters repeatedly**
   - Especially [Unity of Five](../02-core-ideas/06-unity-of-five_en.md)
   - Each reading brings new understanding

### ❌ Things to Avoid

1. **Don't expect to understand everything at once**
   - This is a vast theoretical system
   - Step-by-step progression is important

2. **Don't get lost in mathematical details**
   - Unless you're a theoretical physicist
   - Physical intuition is more important than mathematical techniques

3. **Don't understand concepts in isolation**
   - Each concept connects to others
   - Look at concept maps, understand relationship networks

4. **Don't skip fundamental concepts**
   - Even if you have a physics background
   - GLS theory has new understanding of fundamental concepts

**A**: Yes! Each article tries to be self-contained. But we recommend:

- At least read [Prologue](00-motivation_en.md) and [Unity of Five](../02-core-ideas/06-unity-of-five_en.md) first
- Then choose a path based on interest

### Q3: I'm stuck, what should I do?

**A**:

1. Skip it first, continue reading, maybe it will become clear later
2. Check the glossary
3. Re-read relevant fundamental concept articles
4. Try explaining in your own words to a friend (Feynman technique)

### Q4: Is this theory accepted by the mainstream?

**A**:

This is a developing theoretical framework. It builds on verified physical laws (GR, QFT) but provides a completely new unified perspective.

Criteria for judging a theory:

1. Internal consistency (logical self-consistency)
2. Experimental testability
3. Explaining known phenomena
4. Predicting new phenomena

These will all be discussed in the tutorial.

### Q5: What can I do after reading?

**A**:

- **Conceptual level**: You'll have completely new understanding of time, causality, reality
- **Research level**: You can explore applications and extensions of the theory
- **Teaching level**: You can spread these profound insights to others
- **Philosophical level**: You'll have deeper thoughts about "existence"
