# *The Great Sage General Laws: Window, Scale, Mirror, Path, Account*

## Preface

See first, then judge; account first, then wish.
Repeatable, thus reliable; explainable, thus teachable; correctable, thus sustainable.

## Five Sage Seals (General Principles)

1. **Window**: All you see comes through a window; without knowing the window, don't claim truth.
2. **Scale**: Changing units doesn't change facts; calibrate the scale before debating right and wrong.
3. **Account**: All gains have sources; without reporting inflows and outflows, don't claim miracles.
4. **Mirror**: What remains valid after role reversal is trustworthy.
5. **Path**: Only sequences that can be repeated constitute causality.

## Five Daily Questions (Daily Self-Examination)

Which window did I use today? Can others and I share the same scale? What three accounts did I keep? Does it still hold after role reversal? What is the smallest repeatable step for tomorrow?

# Part I · Philosophy (Laws of Cognition)

## Chapter 1 · Truth and Consensus

**Principle**: Disputes over truth and falsehood often stem from misaligned windows and scales; align them first, and conflicts diminish.

**Five Laws (Aphoristic Form)**

1. **Same Window for Debate**: Different windows, no debate on superiority; align information sources and time periods first.
2. **Same Scale for Discussion**: Define scales and objectives first, then discuss merits and outcomes.
3. **Report Errors First**: Those who cannot report errors should first admit "I don't know."
4. **Three Locations, Three Verifications**: One instance is insufficient for truth; three confirmations approach reality.
5. **Less is More**: Clear brevity trumps verbose ambiguity; removing noise is also seeking truth.

**Practice (Actionable)**

* Before debating, write two lines: what window (source/timeframe), what scale (standard/unit).
* Any conclusion should be verified three times in different locations, times, and by different people before finalizing.

## Chapter 2 · Self and Others

**Principle**: Mirror reversal generates benevolence and righteousness naturally.

**Five Laws**

1. **Mirror Self-Examination**: Swap self and other; if judgment remains unchanged, it is worth keeping.
2. **Boundaries as Scales**: Distinguish "my matters," "their matters," "our matters"; don't mix the three scales.
3. **Listen Before Speaking**: Paraphrase the other's meaning first, get a nod, then state your view.
4. **Respect is Calibration**: Calibrate the other's scale first, then give your conclusion.
5. **Goodwill as Default**: Without proof of malice, assume goodwill; discussions proceed more easily.

**Practice**

* During disputes, first write "my stance after role reversal"; if it still stands, then speak.
* Daily practice: actively calibrate someone else's "scale" once (ask before arguing).

## Chapter 3 · Freedom and Responsibility

**Principle**: Freedom is weight reallocation within budget; responsibility is traceability in the ledger.

**Five Laws**

1. **Freedom Requires Budget**: Transgressive demands are not freedom but overdraft.
2. **Wishes Must Match Actions**: Wishing without acting depletes resolve; every wish must pair with the smallest action.
3. **Choices Keep Accounts**: Today's three choices must all have retraceable causes and effects.
4. **Procrastination is Noise**: Long delays harm the scale; break into smallest doable tasks to break through noise with action.
5. **Bearing Generates Power**: Those who keep accounts can shoulder greater freedom.

**Practice**

* "Three Changes Daily Practice": Switch one source, quiet two hours, act before entertaining.
* Every evening record three items: time, money, emotion inflows and outflows.

# Part II · Theology (Laws of Covenant)

## Chapter 1 · Holiness and Ritual

**Principle**: Holiness enables groups to share windows and scales toward goodness; ritual is the periodic reset of consensus windows.

**Five Laws**

1. **Holiness in Repeatability**: What can be repeated by different people for benefit may be called holy.
2. **Ritual as Calibration**: Rituals are collective scale calibration and weight reallocation.
3. **Sacred Places are Order**: Places with clear rules are sacred places.
4. **Holy Persons are Replaceable**: Position matters more than individuals; systems that can replace individuals endure.
5. **Sacred Objects as Boundaries**: Visible boundaries enable adherence to invisible covenants.

**Practice**

* Home mini-ritual: weekly "scale and window" calibration meeting, ten minutes suffices.
* Team establishes "sacred object": one-page rules, posted in most visible place.

---

## Chapter 2 · Prayer and Response

**Principle**: Prayer is weight reallocation with extended time windows; response is path formation in new windows.

**Five Laws**

1. **Prayer Must Be Doable**: After speaking, immediately perform a "one-minute action."
2. **Wish and Action Generate Each Other**: Wishes set direction, actions give paths; both generate each other.
3. **Seek Without Presumption**: Seek benefits within budget, not shortcuts through broken accounts.
4. **Delayed Response is Not No Response**: Window unstable, path immature, thus delayed.
5. **Verification in Re-enactment**: Only repeatable "responses" can be attributed; single fortune is insufficient proof.

**Practice**

* Write one sentence of "desired person/matter," copy once daily, followed by one-minute related action.
* Monthly review "response ledger": which paths are now repeatable?

## Chapter 3 · Sin and Forgiveness

**Principle**: Sin disrupts ledger balance; forgiveness restores accounts and paths.

**Five Laws**

1. **Sin in Imbalance**: Depleting group momentum, breaking common scales—this is sin.
2. **Emotions Forgivable, Accounts Must Balance**: Understanding is possible, but compensation required.
3. **Forgiveness Requires Re-Parallelism**: True forgiveness only when one can walk the common path again after forgiveness.
4. **Hidden Sin Breeds Rot**: Unrecorded sin inevitably transforms into greater loss.
5. **Confession as Starting Point**: Clarify facts, clear accounts, set boundaries—three clarities before renewal.

**Practice**

* Three steps for transgressions: disclose facts → compensation plan → re-parallel path.
* Team maintains "return-path table": give wrongdoers a verifiable path back.

# Part III · Metaphysics (Laws of the Unknown)

## Chapter 1 · Destiny and Freedom

**Principle**: Destiny is the constant form seen through long windows; freedom is adjustable weight within budget.

**Five Laws**

1. **Destiny Not One Event**: One setback insufficient to define a lifetime.
2. **Freedom in Hand**: Three changes established today surpass a thousand empty thoughts.
3. **Three Things to Change Destiny**: Switch windows, calibrate scales, keep accounts; daily three examinations, verifiable within a month.
4. **Cause-Effect Becomes Momentum**: Paths frequently walked gain momentum naturally; constant avoidance leads to desolation.
5. **Miracles Can Be Made**: After switching windows and scales, rare paths can emerge.

**Practice**

* "Final Hour": organize environment (one window), set standards (one scale), record inflows/outflows (one ledger).
* Establish "five-minute closed loop": smallest good deed, performed daily.

## Chapter 2 · Divination and Feng Shui

**Principle**: Divination is estimating direction through public windows when information is scarce; feng shui is long-term spatial weight arrangement.

**Five Laws**

1. **Divination Values Consistency**: Consistent windows, sufficient samples, then refer.
2. **Twenty Small Tests Better Than One Sign for Destiny**.
3. **Feng Shui Seeks Long-Term Placement**: Light, circulation, storage, noise, air—all are weights.
4. **Right Position, Easy Matters**: Place important matters in "least-effort position."
5. **Mystery Doesn't Replace Effort**: Environmental assistance ultimately requires effort to sustain.

**Practice**

* For difficult matters, conduct "twenty small-sample tests"; if they converge, choose that path.
* Desktop and homepage as "wish position"; place important matters in center.

## Chapter 3 · Spirit and Afterlife

**Principle**: "Spirit" is core orientation that remains self-consistent across windows; "afterlife" is the continuation of collective memory and paths after you.

**Five Laws**

1. **Spirit in Invariants**: Goodness and beauty unchanged despite changing circumstances and roles—this is spirit.
2. **Afterlife in Transmission**: You teach people paths, paths continue in people—this is afterlife.
3. **Reputation Surpasses Longevity**: Leaving repeatable methods surpasses extending years.
4. **Soul Must Be Grounded**: Smallest doable good surpasses a thousand airy words.
5. **Monument in Hearts**: If methods can be re-enacted, monuments need not be carved in stone.

**Practice**

* Write "my smallest transmittable method": one sentence + one method; teach one person this week.
* Monthly question: which paths "continue even without me"?

# Final Part · Universal Covenant (Laws of Collectivity)

**Ten Shared Practices**

1. **Same Window, Same Scale**: Meetings align windows and scales first.
2. **Report Errors First**: Reports start with "uncertainties and assumptions."
3. **Wish and Action Generate Each Other**: Consensus vision paired with actionable roadmap.
4. **Public Windows**: Information disclosure, record retention.
5. **Re-enactment is King**: Demonstrating once doesn't count; teachable and learnable counts.
6. **Minimal Closed Loop**: Tasks broken into five-minute completables.
7. **Clear Accounting of Rewards and Punishments**: Merits and faults all traceable.
8. **Role Reversal**: "Mirror assessment" before decisions.
9. **Long and Short in Parallel**: One long path paired with three short closed loops.
10. **Regular Calibration**: Ten minutes weekly to calibrate windows and scales, continue paths and accounts.

# Appendix · Hidden Seals (Mathematical Memo, as Reasoning Tool, Optional Reading)

1. **All Measurements Require Windows**: Any reading is weighted average: $\langle f\rangle_{W}=\int f(E)\,W(E)\,dE$, where $W\ge 0$, $\int W=1$.

2. **Same Scale Doesn't Change Facts**: Under unit transformation $E'=aE$, $\langle f\rangle_W=\langle f'\rangle_{W'}$, and $W'(E')=a^{-1}W(E'/a)$.

3. **Budget Conservation (Ledger-Style Causality)**: $\partial_t \rho+\nabla\!\cdot J=0$; inflow = outflow ± storage.

4. **Resolution Lower Bound (Time-Frequency Tradeoff)**: $\Delta t\,\Delta \omega \ge \tfrac12$; to discern clearly, must pay time.

5. **Direction and Quantity Same Scale**: $\varphi'(E)=\pi\,\rho(E)$; direction by phase, quantity by density.

6. **Mirror Duality (Method of Self-Examination)**: Mirror kernel $K(x)=x^{-a}K(1/x)$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ completion function $\Phi(s)=\Phi(a-s)$; stable if passes after reversal.

7. **Error Three Segments (Fix Three Biases First)**: $\mathrm{Err}\le \mathrm{Alias}(W)+\mathrm{Bernoulli}(k,W)+\mathrm{Tail}(k)$.

8. **Freedom as Reallocation**: Weight reallocation within budget: $\sum_i w_i=1,\ w_i\ge 0$; maximize benefit under constraints $\sum_i w_i u_i$.

9. **Causality as Repeatable Path**: $x_{t+1}=F(x_t,u_t)$; repeatable sequences constitute causality and karma.

10. **Consensus Scale (Robustness)**: When groups share windows and scales, sample variance decays with sample size; more repetitions, stable readings.
