Read directly:
- "Five Sage Seals" and "Five Daily Questions" from *The Great Sage General Laws* (3 minutes daily)
- Standard cards and tools from Volume C (ready to use)
- Practical scenarios from Volume E (choose relevant domains)

### For In-Depth Study

Reading path:
1. Popular version articles (understand concepts)
2. Corresponding mathematical canon (understand derivations)
3. Verify and practice on your own

### For Organizers

Recommended use:
- *The Great Sage General Laws* as daily team guide

## Core Philosophy

### Five Anchors

- **Window**: All you see comes through a window; without knowing the window, don't claim truth
- **Scale**: Changing units doesn't change facts; calibrate the scale before debating right and wrong
- **Account**: All gains have sources; without reporting inflows and outflows, don't claim miracles
- **Mirror**: What remains valid after role reversal is trustworthy
- **Path**: Only sequences that can be repeated constitute causality

### Five Daily Questions

1. What window did I use today?
2. Can others and I share the same scale?
3. What three accounts did I keep?
4. Does it still hold after role reversal?
5. What is the smallest step I can repeat tomorrow?

**Editorial Note**

This anthology integrates mathematical rigor with philosophical wisdom, aiming to provide a complete methodology from cognition to action.

The Mathematical Canon provides theoretical foundation, Popular Literature offers accessible interpretation, and the Aphoristic Handbook provides daily guidance. The three complement each other to form a complete closed loop.
