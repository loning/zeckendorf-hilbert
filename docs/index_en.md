# Unified Theory System

**From Mathematical Construction of Recursive Mother Space to Computational Origin of Physical Reality**

> *"The history of physics is a history of constantly searching for the underlying 'source code'."*

## System Overview

This theoretical system aims to establish a logically self-consistent and mathematically complete unified framework, eliminating the deep contradictions between quantum mechanics and general relativity, and unifying information, geometry, and physical reality under the same axiomatic system. We propose that the essence of the universe is not a continuous geometric manifold, but a **Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA)** built on discrete lattices following local unitary evolution rules.

**Core Pillars:**
1.  **First Principles**: All things originate from the processing of qubits (It from Qubit Processing).
2.  **Recursive Mathematical Structure**: The universe as a self-contained construction of recursive Hilbert space.
3.  **Duality of Geometry and Information**: Spacetime geometry is the statistical emergence of underlying quantum information entanglement.

## Core Works and Theoretical Modules

### 1. [The First Principles: From Unitary Computation to Physical Reality](./book-first-principles-from-unitary-computation-to-physical-reality/index_en.md)
**The Axiomatic Core**

This is the **axiomatic core** of the theoretical system. Starting from the unique Ultimate Axiom $\Omega$, this book derives the core structures of modern physics.
*   **Discrete Ontology**: Demonstrating why the continuum is merely a mathematical illusion and physical reality must be discrete and finite.
*   **Emergence of Spacetime**: Deriving the origin of the speed of light $c$ from lattice hopping, proving Lorentz transformations are statistical results of resource allocation.
*   **Gravitational Entropic Force**: Deriving the Einstein Field Equations as the IGVP (Information-Geometry-Volume-Pressure) equation of state.
*   **Topological Matter**: Explaining the topological origins of mass, charge, and fermion statistics.

### 2. [Foundations of Physics: Geometry and Information](./book-foundation-of-phys-in-geo-and-info/index_en.md)
**The Geometric and Informational Nature**

Deeply exploring the **geometric and informational nature** of physical laws, systematically elaborated in five volumes:
*   **Volume I: Discrete Ontology** — Holographic Principle, Bekenstein Bound, and Parameterized Universe.
*   **Volume II: Emergence of Time** — Time as a statistical property of microscopic scattering and thermodynamic direction.
*   **Volume III: Gravity and Entropy** — Black hole entropy, holographic entanglement, and microscopic mechanisms of gravity.
*   **Volume IV: Subjectivity in Physics** — Observers, measurement problems, and agency in complex systems.

**Mathematical Foundations**

Providing solid **mathematical foundations** for the unified theory:
*   **Recursive Mother Space**: Self-contained construction of $\mathcal{H}^{(R)}$ and atomic addition principle.
*   **Tag Sequence Theory**: Unifying the recursive generation mechanisms of mathematical constants like $\varphi, e, \pi$.
*   **Mathematization of Quantum Mechanics**: Providing rigorous mathematical explanations for quantum measurement, entanglement, and non-locality.

In-depth exploration based on the ZkT framework:
*   Exploring the philosophical and technical details of the simulated universe hypothesis and computational ontology.

### Experimental Predictions
We have proposed multiple falsifiable experimental predictions in the theory, including:
*   Entanglement gravity detection in microwave cavities.
*   Lorentz violation effects in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.
*   Cosmological drift of the fine-structure constant.
