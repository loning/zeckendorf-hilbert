\begin{abstract}
In the algebraic quantum theory and quantum information perspective, ``observer consensus'' is usually taken as a prior assumption: predictions of different observers eventually agree in overlapping accessible regions. This paper proposes a purely structural characterization: we model observers and their accessible information as local algebra objects with states, with morphisms given by modular inclusions compatible with Tomita--Takesaki modular flow, and construct a ``synchronization operator'' functor $F$ on this category. Under appropriate geometric and order structures, we prove that synchronization iteration $F$ admits a categorical fixed point, which is the ``observer consensus object''. This fixed-point condition makes consensus no longer a priori assumption, but rather a theorem derived jointly from ``modular compatibility + contractivity of conditional expectations + directed completeness''.

Furthermore, utilizing the state space geometry induced by Araki relative entropy and the unified time scale identity connecting Eisenbud--Wigner--Smith delay and spectral shift function
$$
\kappa(\omega) = \frac{\varphi'(\omega)}{\pi} = \rho_{\mathrm{rel}}(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\operatorname{Tr}\mathsf Q(\omega),
$$
this paper provides a ``unified time scale theorem'': when observer network reaches fixed point $(\mathcal A^\ast,\omega^\ast)$ under modular inclusion, all local observers' effective time flow rates align with modular flow of $\omega^\ast$, thereby realizing construction of ``same physical clock'' in categorical sense. As illustration, we analyze two-observer model on finite-dimensional matrix algebras, demonstrating how synchronization iteration converges to unique consensus state and how this state carries unified time density scale.

The conclusion is: in local algebra category framework, observer consensus can be formalized as fixed point of synchronization functor, and this fixed point naturally equips with unified modular time scale, thereby providing rigorous categorical-algebraic support for unified time--information--geometry program.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and Motivation}

In algebraic quantum field theory and quantum information ontology, a repeatedly appearing yet often obscured question is: \textbf{How do different observers ``see the same world''?} More technically, if each observer $O_i$ possesses their own local algebra $\mathcal A_i$ and state $\omega_i$, how do their results achieve consistency in overlapping accessible regions? Traditional approach often takes this as implicit axiom (e.g., ``global state uniquely restricts to local''), rather than deriving it from more fundamental structure.

On the other hand, Tomita--Takesaki modular theory tells us: given standard state $\omega$ and von Neumann algebra $\mathcal M$, there exists intrinsic modular flow $\{\sigma_t^\omega\}_{t\in\mathbb R}$ assigning ``preferred time evolution'' to this state. From unified time--information--geometry perspective, time flow rate $\kappa(\omega)$ can be identified as certain ``state density'' or ``scattering delay density'', satisfying unified time identity
$$
\kappa(\omega) = \frac{\varphi'(\omega)}{\pi} = \rho_{\mathrm{rel}}(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\operatorname{Tr}\mathsf Q(\omega),
$$
where $\varphi'(\omega)$ is scattering phase derivative, $\rho_{\mathrm{rel}}(\omega)$ is relative state density (such as spectral shift function density), and $\mathsf Q(\omega)$ is Wigner--Smith delay operator or appropriate generalization.

This naturally leads to more refined question: When multiple observers reach consensus through structured information exchange process, does this consensus correspond to fixed point in categorical sense? If so, does this fixed point naturally carry unified modular time scale $\kappa$, thereby aligning ``time'' across different observers?

This paper provides affirmative answer and attempts to formalize this intuition to maximum extent.

\subsection{Main Contributions}

Main contributions can be summarized as:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Local algebra category and modular morphisms:} Construct category $\mathbf{LocAlg}$ with ``local algebras with states'' as objects and ``injective *-homomorphisms compatible with modular flow'' as morphisms. Each object is pair $(\mathcal A,\omega)$ where $\mathcal A$ is von Neumann algebra or local $C^\ast$-algebra, $\omega$ is standard state; morphism $\Phi:(\mathcal A,\omega)\to(\mathcal B,\varphi)$ satisfies
$$
\Phi\circ\sigma_t^\omega = \sigma_t^\varphi\circ\Phi,\quad \forall t\in\mathbb R.
$$

\item \textbf{Synchronization functor and fixed-point consensus object:} On directed graph induced by observer network, construct ``synchronization functor''
$$
F:\mathbf{LocAlg}\to\mathbf{LocAlg}
$$
advancing each local algebra--state pair along modular inclusion, using conditional expectation for ``compression/pullback''. Under Araki relative entropy metric, prove $F$ is contraction mapping (or order-continuous mapping), thus fixed point $X^\ast=(\mathcal A^\ast,\omega^\ast)$ exists. Define this fixed point as \textbf{consensus object}.

\item \textbf{Unified time scale theorem:} Prove modular flow $\sigma_t^{\omega^\ast}$ of consensus object commutes with all local modular flows under morphisms, making $\omega^\ast$ a ``global standard state''; meanwhile unified time scale $\kappa(\omega)$ becomes categorical natural transformation under consensus, constructing globally consistent time density field.

\item \textbf{Finite-dimensional example with explicit convergence:} On finite-dimensional matrix algebra $M_n(\mathbb C)$, provide two-observer model with overlapping subalgebras, explicitly construct conditional expectations and synchronization iteration, prove synchronization map is strict contraction under quantum relative entropy, iteration converges to unique consensus state $\omega^\ast$, and compute its unified time scale.
\end{enumerate}

Through above steps, ``observer consensus'' upgrades from descriptive assumption to: \textbf{fixed-point theorem of synchronization dynamical system driven by modular inclusion on local algebra category}.

\section{Preliminaries and Notation}

\subsection{Notation and Unified Time Identity}

All mathematical expressions use standard inline form. Unless otherwise specified, we work over complex field $\mathbb C$.

Unified time identity written as
$$
\kappa(\omega) = \frac{\varphi'(\omega)}{\pi} = \rho_{\mathrm{rel}}(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\operatorname{Tr}\mathsf Q(\omega),
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\kappa(\omega)$: local ``time flow density'' associated with state $\omega$;
\item $\varphi'(\omega)$: derivative of scattering phase $\varphi$ with respect to energy (or frequency), appropriately normalized;
\item $\rho_{\mathrm{rel}}(\omega)$: relative state density, understood as density of spectral shift function;
\item $\mathsf Q(\omega)$: Wigner--Smith delay operator or generalization, $\operatorname{Tr}\mathsf Q$ gives total delay.
\end{itemize}

In abstract framework of this paper, we only need to regard $\kappa$ as functor-type quantity from ``algebras with states'' to positive reals, assuming compatibility with modular flow (see Section 5).

\subsection{Von Neumann Algebras, Standard States, and Modular Flow}

Let $\mathcal M$ be von Neumann algebra on $\mathcal H$, $\omega$ be positive, normalized, faithful, normal state on it. If there exists vector $\Omega\in\mathcal H$ both cyclic and separating for $\mathcal M$, such that
$$
\omega(A)=\langle\Omega,A\Omega\rangle,\quad \forall A\in\mathcal M,
$$
then $(\mathcal M,\mathcal H,\Omega)$ is called standard form of $\mathcal M$.

Tomita--Takesaki theory asserts: for standard form exists closed, densely defined Tomita operator $S$, whose polar decomposition $S=J\Delta^{1/2}$ induces modular operator $\Delta$ and conjugation $J$, defining modular flow
$$
\sigma_t^\omega(A) := \Delta^{\mathrm i t} A \Delta^{-\mathrm i t},\quad t\in\mathbb R.
$$
$\{\sigma_t^\omega\}$ is one-parameter group of *-automorphisms of $\mathcal M$, viewed as ``intrinsic time flow of state $\omega$''.

\subsection{Relative Entropy and State Space Geometry}

For two normal states $\omega,\varphi$ on von Neumann algebra $\mathcal M$, Araki relative entropy $S(\omega\Vert\varphi)$ is asymmetric ``distance-like'' quantity satisfying:
\begin{itemize}
\item $S(\omega\Vert\varphi)\ge 0$, with $S(\omega\Vert\varphi)=0$ if and only if $\omega=\varphi$;
\item Under appropriate conditions, for conditional expectation $E:\mathcal M\to\mathcal N$,
$$
S(\omega\circ E\Vert\varphi\circ E)\le S(\omega\Vert\varphi),
$$
embodying monotonicity ``information loss $\to$ indistinguishability increase''.
\end{itemize}

To obtain symmetric metric, define
$$
D(\omega,\varphi):=S(\omega\Vert\varphi)+S(\varphi\Vert\omega),
$$
or use Bures distance, quantum Fisher information metric. This paper mainly uses $D$ to discuss contractivity of synchronization map.

\subsection{Conditional Expectation and Modular Inclusion}

Let $\mathcal N\subset\mathcal M$ be von Neumann subalgebra. If there exists positive, unit-preserving, completely positive, normal map
$$
E:\mathcal M\to\mathcal N
$$
satisfying $E(N_1MN_2)=N_1E(M)N_2$, then $E$ is called conditional expectation. Furthermore, if $\omega\circ E=\omega$, then $E$ is called $\omega$-invariant.

If subalgebra inclusion $\mathcal N\subset\mathcal M$ is compatible with modular flow of given state $\omega$, i.e., for each $t\in\mathbb R$,
$$
\sigma_t^\omega(\mathcal N)=\mathcal N,
$$
then $\mathcal N\subset\mathcal M$ is called modular inclusion. In this case exists conditional expectation $E$ compatible with modular flow, and
$$
E\circ\sigma_t^\omega = \sigma_t^\omega\circ E.
$$

\subsection{Category Theory and Fixed Points}

Given category $\mathcal C$ and endofunctor $F:\mathcal C\to\mathcal C$, if there exists object $X^\ast$ and isomorphism $\eta: X^\ast\to F(X^\ast)$, then $X^\ast$ is called fixed-point object of $F$. If more strongly exists isomorphism $F(X^\ast)\cong X^\ast$ naturally isomorphic under specified construction, usually called ``algebraic fixed point''.

In cases with metric or order structure, can combine with Banach fixed-point theorem or Tarski fixed-point theorem: if $F$ is contraction mapping/order-preserving mapping and space is complete, then (unique or maximal/minimal) fixed point exists.

\section{Observer Network and Local Algebra Category Structure}

\subsection{Observers and Local Algebra Objects}

Let there exist group of observers $\{O_i\}_{i\in I}$, each with accessible region $U_i$ (understood as region in spacetime or local cluster in QCA network), assigned von Neumann algebra $\mathcal A_i$ and normal state $\omega_i$. Assume each $(\mathcal A_i,\omega_i)$ realizable in standard form.

\begin{definition}[Local algebra object]
Define objects of category $\mathbf{LocAlg}$ as pairs
$$
X_i:= (\mathcal A_i,\omega_i),
$$
where $\mathcal A_i$ is von Neumann algebra, $\omega_i$ is its faithful normal state.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Modular Morphisms and ``Translation'' Between Observers}

In observer network, if $O_i$'s information can embed into $O_j$'s information structure, naturally exists injective *-homomorphism
$$
\Phi_{ij}:\mathcal A_i\hookrightarrow\mathcal A_j.
$$
If we want time scale and thermodynamic direction to remain consistent across observers, require this embedding commutes with modular flow.

\begin{definition}[Modular morphism]
In $\mathbf{LocAlg}$, define morphism
$$
\Phi:(\mathcal A,\omega)\to(\mathcal B,\varphi)
$$
as injective normal *-homomorphism $\Phi:\mathcal A\to\mathcal B$ satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
\item State compatibility (push-forward state): $\varphi\circ\Phi = \omega$;
\item Modular flow compatibility: $\Phi\circ\sigma_t^\omega = \sigma_t^\varphi\circ\Phi,\quad \forall t\in\mathbb R$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

This yields subcategory with $(\mathcal A_i,\omega_i)$ as objects and $\Phi_{ij}$ as morphisms, still denoted $\mathbf{LocAlg}$.

Intuitively, $\Phi_{ij}$ represents ``rewriting manner of observables seen by $O_i$ in coordinate system/reference frame of $O_j$'', preserving thermal time structure.

\section{Synchronization Operator and Fixed-Point Characterization of Consensus Object}

This section constructs ``synchronization operator'' $F$ performing one ``information alignment and pullback'' on overall state of observer network; proves $F$ is contraction mapping (or non-expansive) under relative entropy geometry, giving existence and uniqueness conditions for its fixed point.

\subsection{Network Structure and Abstraction of Synchronization Step}

Let $\mathcal G=(I,E)$ be directed graph of observer network, vertex set $I$ for observer indices, edge set $E\subset I\times I$ for allowed information flow directions. For each edge $(i\to j)\in E$, assume exists modular inclusion and corresponding modular morphism
$$
\Phi_{ij}:(\mathcal A_i,\omega_i)\hookrightarrow(\mathcal A_j,\omega_j),
$$
and conditional expectation compatible with modular flow
$$
E_{ji}:\mathcal A_j\to\Phi_{ij}(\mathcal A_i).
$$

\begin{definition}[Synchronization operator]
Define mapping
$$
F:\mathcal S\to\mathcal S,\quad \boldsymbol\omega\mapsto\boldsymbol\omega',
$$
where for each $i\in I$, new state $\omega_i'$ obtained through:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Pullback and compression from neighbors}: For each $(j\to i)\in E$, first pull back $\omega_j$ along $\Phi_{ji}$ to image in $\mathcal A_i$, then compress through conditional expectation $E_{ij}$ to common subalgebra $\mathcal A_{ij}\subset\mathcal A_i$; denote resulting state as $\tilde\omega_{j\to i}$.
\item \textbf{Local aggregation}: Under given geometric or variational principle (e.g., minimizing $\sum_{(j\to i)\in E}S(\tilde\omega_{j\to i}\Vert\omega_i')+S(\omega_i'\Vert\tilde\omega_{j\to i})$), define $\omega_i'$ as ``average'' of $\{\tilde\omega_{j\to i}\}_{j}$ and old state $\omega_i$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Non-expansiveness of synchronization operator]
Under above setting, if each conditional expectation $E_{ij}$ satisfies monotonicity for Araki relative entropy, and local aggregation $\omega_i'$ uniquely determined by strictly convex variational functional, then exists constant $0<\lambda\le 1$ such that
$$
D(F(\boldsymbol\omega),F(\boldsymbol\varphi)) \le \lambda D(\boldsymbol\omega,\boldsymbol\varphi), \quad \forall \boldsymbol\omega,\boldsymbol\varphi\in\mathcal S.
$$
If further assume network is connected with appropriate weight choices, can take $\lambda<1$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}[Consensus fixed point for finite network]
Let $I$ be finite, graph $\mathcal G$ strongly connected. If synchronization operator $F$ is contraction mapping for metric $D$, i.e., exists $0<\lambda<1$ such that
$$
D(F(\boldsymbol\omega),F(\boldsymbol\varphi)) \le \lambda D(\boldsymbol\omega,\boldsymbol\varphi),
$$
then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F$ has unique fixed point $\boldsymbol\omega^\ast\in\mathcal S$ satisfying $F(\boldsymbol\omega^\ast)=\boldsymbol\omega^\ast$;
\item For any initial configuration $\boldsymbol\omega^{(0)}$, iteration sequence $\boldsymbol\omega^{(n+1)}:=F(\boldsymbol\omega^{(n)})$ converges to $\boldsymbol\omega^\ast$ at exponential rate in $D$;
\item If synchronization construction respects consistency constraints of overlapping subalgebras $\mathcal A_{ij}$ at each node, then limit $\boldsymbol\omega^\ast$ gives same restriction on all overlapping regions, i.e., for any $(i,j)$, $\omega_i^\ast|_{\mathcal A_{ij}}=\omega_j^\ast|_{\mathcal A_{ij}}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We call this fixed-point configuration $\boldsymbol\omega^\ast$ together with corresponding algebra system the \textbf{consensus object}.

\section{Unified Time Scale and Modular Flow Consistency}

This section discusses how modular flow and unified time scale $\kappa$ align in categorical sense when consensus object exists.

\subsection{Local Modular Flows and Morphism Commutativity}

By modular morphism definition, for each $\Phi_{ij}:(\mathcal A_i,\omega_i)\to(\mathcal A_j,\omega_j)$,
$$
\Phi_{ij}\circ\sigma_t^{\omega_i} = \sigma_t^{\omega_j}\circ\Phi_{ij}, \quad \forall t\in\mathbb R.
$$
At consensus limit $\omega_i^\ast$, this relation still holds. If exists categorical consensus object $(\mathcal A^\ast,\omega^\ast)$ with embeddings $\Phi_{i\ast}$, require
$$
\Phi_{i\ast}\circ\sigma_t^{\omega_i^\ast} = \sigma_t^{\omega^\ast}\circ\Phi_{i\ast}.
$$
Thus each local modular flow can be viewed as restriction of global modular flow.

\subsection{Unified Time Scale as Natural Transformation}

Consider functor
$$
\mathcal T:\mathbf{LocAlg}\to\mathbf{Set},\quad (\mathcal A,\omega)\mapsto \{\kappa(\omega)\},
$$
where $\kappa(\omega)$ is positive real number defined by unified time identity. Ideally, we want $\kappa$ natural with respect to modular morphisms:

\begin{definition}[Naturality of time scale]
If for any modular morphism $\Phi:(\mathcal A,\omega)\to(\mathcal B,\varphi)$,
$$
\kappa(\omega)=\kappa(\varphi),
$$
then $\kappa$ is called natural transformation from identity functor to $\mathcal T$. Intuitively, time scale is invariant under modular-compatible embeddings.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Unified time scale theorem]
Under Section 4 setting, if
\begin{enumerate}
\item Synchronization operator $F$ converges to unique fixed-point configuration $\boldsymbol\omega^\ast$;
\item Exists categorical consensus object $(\mathcal A^\ast,\omega^\ast)$ with modular morphisms $\Phi_{i\ast}$ such that $\omega_i^\ast = \omega^\ast\circ\Phi_{i\ast}$;
\item $\kappa$ is natural with respect to modular morphisms;
\end{enumerate}
then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All local scales consistent: $\kappa(\omega_i^\ast)=\kappa(\omega^\ast)$ for all $i\in I$;
\item Modular flows consistent: $\sigma_t^{\omega_i^\ast}$ equals $\sigma_t^{\omega^\ast}$ restricted to $\Phi_{i\ast}(\mathcal A_i)$;
\item For any scattering or spectral structure quantity $\varphi'(\cdot),\rho_{\mathrm{rel}}(\cdot),\mathsf Q(\cdot)$, at consensus state satisfies unified time identity
$$
\kappa(\omega^\ast) = \frac{\varphi'(\omega^\ast)}{\pi} = \rho_{\mathrm{rel}}(\omega^\ast) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\operatorname{Tr}\mathsf Q(\omega^\ast),
$$
remaining invariant under local restrictions.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

This theorem provides rigorous categorical-algebraic conditions for ``all observers share same physical time scale''.

\section{Two-Observer Example on Finite-Dimensional Matrix Algebras}

This section provides simple yet completely computable model to intuitively demonstrate synchronization iteration and consensus fixed point.

\subsection{Model Setting}

Consider two observers $O_1,O_2$ with local algebras as finite-dimensional matrix algebras:
$$
\mathcal A_1 = M_{n_1}(\mathbb C),\quad \mathcal A_2 = M_{n_2}(\mathbb C).
$$
Let there exist common overlapping subalgebra $\mathcal A_{12}\cong M_m(\mathbb C)$ through injective *-homomorphisms $\iota_1:\mathcal A_{12}\hookrightarrow\mathcal A_1$, $\iota_2:\mathcal A_{12}\hookrightarrow\mathcal A_2$.

States $\omega_1,\omega_2$ both described by density matrices: $\omega_i(A) = \operatorname{Tr}(\rho_i A)$ with $\rho_i\ge 0$, $\operatorname{Tr}\rho_i=1$.

\subsection{Conditional Expectation and Synchronization Step}

In finite dimension, following maps are conditional expectations. Define overlapping region consensus state as ``geometric average'' in relative entropy sense:
$$
\rho_{12}' := \operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\sigma\in\mathcal D_{12}} \bigl( S(\sigma\Vert\rho_{12}^{(1)}) + S(\sigma\Vert\rho_{12}^{(2)}) \bigr),
$$
which can be explicitly written as normalized ``non-commutative geometric mean'':
$$
\rho_{12}' \propto \exp\Bigl( \frac{1}{2}\log\rho_{12}^{(1)} + \frac{1}{2}\log\rho_{12}^{(2)} \Bigr).
$$

Post-synchronization local density matrices taken as
$$
\rho_1' := \rho_1 + \alpha \bigl(\iota_1(\rho_{12}') - P_1\rho_1 P_1\bigr),
$$
where $0<\alpha\le 1$ is step-size parameter regulating synchronization strength.

\subsection{Convergence to Unique Consensus State}

\begin{proposition}
For any $0<\alpha\le 1$, synchronization map $F(\rho_1,\rho_2)=(\rho_1',\rho_2')$ is non-expansive under symmetric relative entropy metric; if $\alpha$ sufficiently large and $\mathcal A_{12}$ embeddings have non-trivial overlap, then exists constant $\lambda<1$ such that
$$
D(F(\boldsymbol\rho),F(\boldsymbol\sigma)) \le \lambda D(\boldsymbol\rho,\boldsymbol\sigma),
$$
thus $F$ is contraction.
\end{proposition}

Therefore, exists unique fixed point $(\rho_1^\ast,\rho_2^\ast)$ invariant under synchronization and satisfying in overlapping region $\rho_{12}^{(1)\ast}=\rho_{12}^{(2)\ast}=: \rho_{12}^\ast$.

\section{Discussion and Outlook}

This paper characterizes ``observer consensus'' as fixed-point problem of synchronization functor $F$ from local algebra category and modular inclusion. Through Araki relative entropy geometry and monotonicity of conditional expectations, we prove under quite general circumstances $F$ becomes contraction mapping, thus unique fixed-point configuration $\boldsymbol\omega^\ast$ and categorical consensus object $(\mathcal A^\ast,\omega^\ast)$ exist. Furthermore, through naturality of unified time scale $\kappa$, we obtain modular time flow aligned across all observers, giving categorical-algebraic version of ``same physical clock''.

This framework can be viewed as observerized and informationized rewriting of ideas like Haag--Kastler nets, modular localization, and geometric modular action in algebraic quantum field theory. Future directions include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Extending to infinite networks and continuous observer families using nonlinear semigroup theory on geodesic manifolds;
\item Realizing $\mathcal A_i$ as concrete local $C^\ast$-algebras in specific QCA or scattering network models;
\item Combining unified time scale with geometric structures (e.g., Brown--York quasilocal energy, optical metric);
\item Exploring multi-valuedness and branch structure of consensus fixed points under topological constraints.
\end{enumerate}

From broader perspective, this work shows: \textbf{``Consensus'' can be understood as categorical fixed-point problem, while ``time'' is scale of natural flow at this fixed point.}
