# Zeta Function Strange Loop Recursive Construction and Universe Generation: From Complex Plane to AdS/CFT Holographic Duality

## Abstract

This paper systematically expounds the fixed point recursive structure of the Riemann zeta function and its role in universe generation. By establishing strict mathematical frameworks, we explore the possibility of zeta functions serving as bridges connecting prime numbers, quantum physics, and cosmology concepts, proposing a unified mathematical-physical framework. Our main contributions include: (1) Establishing formal definitions of zeta function recursive fixed points, proving the first-order closure theorem $R_{n+1}(s) = R_n(s) = \zeta(s)$; (2) Proposing physical interpretations of non-trivial zeros as collapse points, where each zero may correspond to a specific matter eigenstate; (3) Exploring the two-dimensional structure of the complex plane, the complementary roles of real and imaginary axes in information encoding; (4) Establishing correspondences between complex planes and AdS/CFT duality, interpreting analytic continuation as AdS volume expansion; (5) Constructing theoretical generation paths from primes to universes; (6) Proposing unified frameworks for universe fixed point structures. This paper not only provides new perspectives for understanding deep universe structures, but also gives verifiable physical predictions, including correspondences between zero point statistics and particle spectra, associations between critical lines and symmetry breaking, unified descriptions of holographic entropy and black hole information.

## Part I: Mathematical Foundations of Zeta Function Fixed Point Recursion

### Chapter 1: Formal Definition of Fixed Point Recursion

#### 1.1 Construction of Recursive Operators

The functional equation $s \leftrightarrow 1-s$ of the Riemann zeta function provides a natural recursive structure. We establish the strict mathematical framework for fixed point recursion, extending this symmetry into stable structures.

**Definition 1.1 (Fixed Point Recursive Operator)**:
Fixed point recursion refers to the recursive sequence generated by the zeta function's functional equation, embodying the stable properties of mathematical structures.

Define the recursive sequence $\{R_n(s)\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ as follows:
$$R_0(s) := \zeta(s)$$
$$R_{n+1}(s) := F(s) \cdot R_n(1-s)$$

where $F(s)$ is the coefficient function of the functional equation:
$$F(s) = 2^s \pi^{s-1} \sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right) \Gamma(1-s)$$

**Corrected Note**: From the zeta function functional equation $\zeta(s) = F(s) \zeta(1-s)$, directly we have $R_n(s) = \zeta(s)$ for all $n \geq 0$.

**Key Properties**:
1. **First-order Closure**: The sequence immediately fixes at $\zeta(s)$ (see Theorem 1.1)
2. **Analyticity**: Each $R_n(s)$ is analytic in appropriate regions of the complex plane
3. **Symmetry**: Embodies the basic $s \leftrightarrow 1-s$ symmetry

**Physical Significance**:
- **Fixed Point** $R_n(s) = \zeta(s)$: Stable mathematical encoding of the universe
- **Mirror Symmetry**: Recursion reflects the basic $s \leftrightarrow 1-s$ symmetry of zeta functions
- **Universe Process**: Fixed point structure embodies the mathematical self-consistency of the universe

#### 1.2 First-Order Closure Theorem

The core property of fixed point recursion is its closure. We prove that this recursive sequence immediately fixes at the zeta function.

**Theorem 1.1 (First-Order Closure Theorem)**:
For the recursive sequence defined above, we have:
$$R_{n+1}(s) = R_n(s) = \zeta(s), \quad \forall n \geq 0, \quad s \notin \{1\} \cup \{\rho_k\}$$

where $\rho_k$ are non-trivial zeros, and $s=1$ is the zeta function pole.

**Proof**:
From the zeta function functional equation $\zeta(s) = F(s) \zeta(1-s)$, directly we have:
$$R_1(s) = F(s) \cdot R_0(1-s) = F(s) \cdot \zeta(1-s) = \zeta(s) = R_0(s)$$

By induction: Assume $R_k(s) = \zeta(s)$, then $R_{k+1}(s) = F(s) \cdot R_k(1-s) = F(s) \cdot \zeta(1-s) = \zeta(s)$.

Therefore, all $R_n(s) = \zeta(s)$ for all $n \geq 0$.

Although $F(s) \cdot F(1-s) = 1$ still holds (proof same as above), this does not lead to a second-order cycle, but ensures the self-consistency of the transformation. □

The physical significance of this theorem:
- **Fixedness**: Universe structure immediately reaches stable state
- **Self-consistency**: Recursive closure guarantees the internal consistency of the universe
- **Duality**: The $s \leftrightarrow 1-s$ symmetry is the basic symmetry of the universe

#### 1.3 Information Density of Fixed Structure

Since the sequence fixes at the zeta function, all "levels" are identical.

**Unified Information Density Standard**:

Based on the functional equation and complex geometry, we adopt the unified ζ-information triadic balance theoretical framework.

**Total Information Density**:
$$\mathcal{I}_{\text{total}}(s) = |\zeta(s)|^2 + |\zeta(1-s)|^2 + |\Re[\zeta(s)\overline{\zeta(1-s)}]| + |\Im[\zeta(s)\overline{\zeta(1-s)}]|$$

**Information Component Definitions**:
1. **Positive Information Component** (Constructive Contribution):
$$\mathcal{I}_+(s) = \frac{1}{2} \left( |\zeta(s)|^2 + |\zeta(1-s)|^2 \right) + [\Re[\zeta(s)\overline{\zeta(1-s)}]]^+$$

2. **Negative Information Component** (Compensatory Contribution):
$$\mathcal{I}_-(s) = \frac{1}{2} \left( |\zeta(s)|^2 + |\zeta(1-s)|^2 \right) + [\Re[\zeta(s)\overline{\zeta(1-s)}]]^-$$

3. **Zero Information Component** (Fluctuation Contribution):
$$\mathcal{I}_0(s) = |\Im[\zeta(s)\overline{\zeta(1-s)}]|$$

where $[x]^+ = \max(x, 0)$, $[x]^- = \max(-x, 0)$, and $[\Re]^+ - [\Re]^- = \Re$, $[\Re]^+ + [\Re]^- = |\Re|$.

**Normalized Information Components**:
$$i_\alpha(s) = \frac{\mathcal{I}_\alpha(s)}{\mathcal{I}_+(s) + \mathcal{I}_0(s) + \mathcal{I}_-(s)}, \quad \alpha \in \{+, 0, -\}$$

**Information Conservation Law**:
$$i_+(s) + i_0(s) + i_-(s) = 1$$

**Physical Interpretation**:
- $\mathcal{I}_+$: Corresponds to particle properties, energy conservation, discrete spectra, etc.
- $\mathcal{I}_0$: Corresponds to phase information, interference effects, quantum coherence, etc.
- $\mathcal{I}_-$: Corresponds to vacuum fluctuations, Casimir effects, quantum zero-point energy, etc.

**Simple Information Density**:
For compatibility, we also define simple information density:
$$\rho(s) = |\zeta(s)|^2$$
