Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled "Static-Block Cellular Automata: Information Laws and Observable Languages" for consideration as an Article in Nature Communications.

KEY CONTRIBUTIONS (8-point checklist):

1. EXPLICIT CONDITIONAL COMPLEXITY BOUNDS (Theorem T4): We provide the first quantitative O(log|W|) overhead bound for observable sequences under causal thick-boundary conditions, enabling per-window upper bounds without invoking entropy-theoretic limits first.

2. CONSTRUCTIVE BÜCHI AUTOMATON SYNTHESIS (Theorem T13): We give an explicit finite-state construction with computable size bounds (|Q| ≤ |Σ|^{|R|·k}) for leaf languages under time-Markovizability, with complexity O(|B|·|Σ|^|B|) per transition step.

3. REPRODUCIBLE EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION: We provide zero-error thick-boundary reconstruction (T4) and Kolmogorov-complexity convergence experiments (T5) on Rule-110 and Rule-90, with full open-source code repository.

4. MULTI-ANCHOR SUBJECTIVE TIME FORMALISM (T17-T18): We prove observation entropy rate scales as 1/b with step-size b, with coordinate-relativization invariance under unimodular transformations.

5. NORMALIZATION DISCIPLINE: We systematically distinguish temporal-thickness normalization (h_μ(σ_time)) from voxel-count normalization (h_μ^(d+1)), preventing cross-normalization errors prevalent in prior literature.

6. STATIC-BLOCK UNFOLDING (SBU): We introduce anchor-relative event cones reconciling apparent choice with determinism via information non-increase, formalizing "time as reading" without global time coordinates.

7. DUAL FORMULATION EQUIVALENCE: All results hold for both subshift-of-finite-type (X_f) and eternal-graph edge-shift (Y_G, σ) presentations, unified by graph-shift display/encoding equivalence.

8. PORTABLE TOOLKIT: EBOC provides reusable tools for complexity bounds, automata construction, and entropy analysis applicable to any locally-constrained dynamical system, with explicit algorithmic protocols.

SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY:

This work addresses a fundamental gap in symbolic dynamics and cellular automata theory: explicit conditional-complexity characterization under observation. Prior results (Brudno, Li-Vitányi) provide asymptotic density limits but lack constructive per-window bounds. Our T4 fills this gap with tight logarithmic overhead, while T13 provides the first size-bounded automaton construction under explicit finiteness conditions.

The framework unifies three traditionally separate domains—subshifts of finite type, Kolmogorov complexity, and ω-automata—into a single verifiable system with reproducible experiments. Our thick-boundary experiments achieve perfect reconstruction, and compression-entropy experiments demonstrate Brudno convergence on universal-computation systems (Rule-110) vs linear systems (Rule-90).

INTERDISCIPLINARY RELEVANCE:

• Computer Science: resource-bounded complexity, program verification
• Mathematics: symbolic dynamics, ergodic theory, computability
• Physics: block-universe models, information conservation laws
• AI: formal verification, decidability boundaries
