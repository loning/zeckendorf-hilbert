# 1.3.5 Dynamic Selection and Continuous Birth Theory

## Definition 1.3.5 (Self-optimization Selection Strategy)

In the generation process of recursive mother space, the system selects a sequence of parameters $\{\sigma_n\} \subset (0,1)$, satisfying **self-optimization selection strategy**:

$$\boxed{\limsup_{n \to \infty}\left(D(\sigma_n) - \inf_{\sigma} D(\sigma)\right) = 0}$$

Denote this assumption as **(G)**.

### Intuitive Interpretation

**Self-optimization Selection Strategy** means the system asymptotically selects "most unshielded" directions:
- System continuously seeks abscissas that minimize shielding function $D(\sigma)$
- In long-term evolution, selected $\sigma_n$ increasingly approach global minimum shielding point
- Embodies system's "intelligent optimization" tendency

## Definition 1.3.6 (Continuous Birth Function and Sustained Birth)

### Continuous Birth Function Definition

Let $\Gamma \subset (0,1)$ be feasible region of weights. Given **continuous birth upper bound function**:
$$\Psi : [0,1] \times \Gamma \to [0,\infty)$$

satisfying the following properties:
1. **Zero Point Property**: $\Psi(0, \gamma) = 0$ for all $\gamma \in \Gamma$
2. **Monotonicity**: $\Psi$ is monotonically non-decreasing in both parameters
3. **Continuity**: $\Psi$ is continuous on its domain

### Birth Quantity Constraint

"Perceivable birth quantity" $N_{n+1}$ at each step is controlled by:
$$N_{n+1} \leq \Psi(D(\sigma_n), \gamma_n)$$

### Sustained Birth Condition

Call the system **sustainedly birthing** if there exist constant $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ and infinitely many indices $\{n_k\}$ such that:

$$\boxed{N_{n_k} \geq \varepsilon_0 \quad (\forall k)}$$

and require that injection weights at these steps do not degenerate: there exists $\gamma^\star \in \Gamma$ such that $\gamma_{n_k} \geq \gamma^\star$.

Denote this total assumption as **(U)**.

### Mathematical Interpretation

**Key Properties of Continuous Birth Function $\Psi$**:
- **$\Psi(x,\gamma) \to 0$ when $x \to 0$**: Reflects "no perceivable birth when unshielded ($x=0$)"
- **Monotonicity**: Higher degree of shielding leads to greater birth potential
- **Continuity**: Ensures mathematical analyzability of optimization process

**Meaning of Sustained Birth (U)**:
- **Non-degeneracy**: System always maintains minimum level of birth capability
- **Infinitely Many Times**: Birth is not occasional phenomenon, but sustained characteristic of system
- **Weight Guarantee**: Injection mechanism does not degenerate to ineffective state

## Theorem 1.3.7 (Typical Implementation of Continuous Birth Function)

### Power-law Type Continuous Birth Function

An important class of continuous birth function implementations:
$$\Psi(x, \gamma) = C \cdot \gamma \cdot x^\alpha$$

where $C, \alpha > 0$ are constants related to specific encoding.

### Verification of Key Properties

**Verification of Zero Point Property**:
$$\Psi(0, \gamma) = C \cdot \gamma \cdot 0^\alpha = 0$$

holds strictly for all $\gamma \in \Gamma$.

**Verification of Monotonicity**:
- Monotonic in $x$: $\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x} = C \gamma \alpha x^{\alpha-1} \geq 0$
- Monotonic in $\gamma$: $\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \gamma} = C x^\alpha \geq 0$

**Verification of Continuity**: Continuity of power functions is obvious. $\square$

## Corollary 1.3.8 (Specific Implementation of Birth Quantity)

### Entropy Increase as Birth Quantity

If we take $N_{n+1}$ as entropy increase $\Delta S_{n+1}$, then birth constraint becomes:
$$\Delta S_{n+1} \leq \Psi(D(\sigma_n), \gamma_n)$$

This establishes direct connection between **information-theoretic entropy increase** and **geometric shielding function**.

### Unification with Recursive Tag Theory

In recursive mother space framework, birth constraint explicitly relates entropy increase $\Delta S_{n+1}$ with tag modulation of atomic addition orthogonal basis:

$$\Delta S_{n+1} = g(F_{n+1}(\{a_k\}_{k=0}^{n+1})) \leq \Psi(D(\sigma_n), \gamma_n)$$

where:
- **$\Delta S_{n+1}$ corresponds**: Strictly positive entropy increase contribution from each recursive generation new dimension
- **$g(F_{n+1}) > 0$ corresponds**: Information increment modulation of tag modes
- **$\gamma_n$ corresponds**: Modulation parameters of tag coefficients
- **$D(\sigma_n)$ corresponds**: Shielding degree of tag subspaces

This ensures each recursive generation adds only single orthogonal basis $\mathbb{C} e_n$ atomic contribution, strengthening non-terminating logical increase of infinite recursion.

### **Core Value of Dynamic Selection Theory**

#### **1. Mathematization of System Evolution**:
- **Selection Strategy**: From intuitive "optimization" to rigorous mathematical condition (G)
- **Birth Process**: From vague "innovation" to precise continuous birth function $\Psi$
- **Sustainability**: From qualitative "continuity" to quantitative lower bound condition (U)

#### **2. Unification of Geometry and Dynamics**:
- **Static Geometry**: Geometric properties of shielding function $D(\sigma)$
- **Dynamic Process**: Evolution of selection strategy $\{\sigma_n\}$
- **Unified Framework**: Connecting geometry and dynamics through continuous birth function

#### **3. Preparation for Main Theorem**:
- **Optimization Objective**: Geometric meaning of $\inf D(\sigma)$
- **Dynamic Constraints**: Upper bound constraints of continuous birth function
- **Contradiction Mechanism**: Potential conflict between optimization and birth

### **Mathematical Rigor of Theory**

#### **Explicitness of Assumptions**:
- **(G)**: Precise mathematical expression of self-optimization selection
- **(U)**: Quantified conditions for sustained birth
- **$\Psi$**: General framework of continuous birth function

#### **Reasonableness of Conditions**:
- **$\Psi(0,\gamma) = 0$**: Reflects naturalness of no birth when unshielded
- **Monotonicity**: Positive correlation between shielding and birth
- **Sustainability**: Basic requirement of system vitality

This dynamic selection theory provides rigorous mathematical tools for analyzing interaction between geometric RH and system evolution.
