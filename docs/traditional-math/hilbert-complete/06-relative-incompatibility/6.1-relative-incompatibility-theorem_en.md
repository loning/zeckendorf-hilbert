# Chapter 6: Relative Incompatibility Theorem

## 6.1 Main Theorem: Incompatibility of RH with "Self-Optimization + Continuous Birth"

### Proposition 6.1 (Self-Optimization Absorption under Geometric RH)

If $\text{RH}_{\text{geo}}$ and self-optimization selection strategy (G) both hold, then:

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sigma_n = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \lim_{n \to \infty} D(\sigma_n) = 0$$

### Proof

**Step 1**: Uniqueness of global minimum
By $\text{RH}_{\text{geo}}$, the unique global minimum of shielding function $D(\sigma)$ is at $\sigma = \frac{1}{2}$, and:
$$\inf_{\sigma} D(\sigma) = D(1/2) = 0$$

**Step 2**: Convergence of self-optimization strategy
By assumption (G):
$$\limsup_{n \to \infty}(D(\sigma_n) - \inf_{\sigma} D(\sigma)) = \limsup_{n \to \infty}(D(\sigma_n) - 0) = 0$$

Therefore:
$$\limsup_{n \to \infty} D(\sigma_n) = 0$$

**Step 3**: Convergence of abscissa
Since $D(\sigma) \geq 0$ always holds, we have $\liminf_{n \to \infty} D(\sigma_n) \geq 0$.
Combined with $\limsup_{n \to \infty} D(\sigma_n) = 0$, we get:
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} D(\sigma_n) = 0$$

**Step 4**: Application of uniqueness
By $\text{RH}_{\text{geo}}$, $D(\sigma) = 0$ if and only if $\sigma = \frac{1}{2}$.
By continuity of $D(\sigma)$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} D(\sigma_n) = 0$, we must have:
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sigma_n = \frac{1}{2}$$

$\square$

## Theorem 6.2 (Relative Incompatibility Theorem)

Under the self-referential complete entropy increase framework, if the following three conditions hold simultaneously:

1. **$\text{RH}_{\text{geo}}$**: Geometric version Riemann Hypothesis
2. **(G)**: Self-optimization selection strategy  
3. **(U)**: Continuous birth condition

then a contradiction arises.

Equivalently:
$$\boxed{\text{RH}_{\text{geo}} \text{ and } (G) + (U) \text{ cannot coexist}}$$

### Proof

**Step 1**: Apply Proposition 6.1
By Proposition 6.1, under conditions $\text{RH}_{\text{geo}} \wedge (G)$:
$$\sigma_n \to \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad D(\sigma_n) \to 0$$

**Step 2**: Upper bound analysis of birth quantity
Take the infinite subsequence $\{n_k\}$ and constant $\gamma^\star > 0$ given in assumption (U).

By the birth upper bound constraint:
$$N_{n_k} \leq \Psi(D(\sigma_{n_k}), \gamma_{n_k})$$

**Step 3**: Convergence of upper bound
Since $\gamma_{n_k} \geq \gamma^\star$ and by monotonicity of $\Psi$:
$$N_{n_k} \leq \Psi(D(\sigma_{n_k}), \gamma_{n_k}) \leq \Psi(D(\sigma_{n_k}), \gamma^\star)$$

**Step 4**: Generation of contradiction
By continuity and monotonicity of $\Psi$ and $\Psi(0, \gamma^\star) = 0$:
$$\lim_{k \to \infty} \Psi(D(\sigma_{n_k}), \gamma^\star) = \Psi\left(\lim_{k \to \infty} D(\sigma_{n_k}), \gamma^\star\right) = \Psi(0, \gamma^\star) = 0$$

Therefore:
$$\lim_{k \to \infty} N_{n_k} = 0$$

But this contradicts $N_{n_k} \geq \varepsilon_0 > 0$ from assumption (U).

**Conclusion**: The three assumptions cannot hold simultaneously. $\square$

## Corollary 6.3 (Three-Choice Law)

In the self-referential complete entropy increase framework, the following three cannot all be true:

1. **$\text{RH}_{\text{geo}}$**: Unique unshielded point on the critical line
2. **(G)**: Asymptotic self-optimization selection (continuous approach to minimum shielding)
3. **(U)**: Continuous birth (infinitely many steps with unified positive lower bound birth)

### Logical Branch Analysis

#### **Branch 1**: If insisting on $(G) + (U)$
Then $\text{RH}_{\text{geo}}$ must be false.

**Interpretation**: In a dynamic system with self-optimization and continuous birth, there cannot exist a unique unshielded point, because this would lead to system absorption to that point and loss of birth capacity.

#### **Branch 2**: If $\text{RH}_{\text{geo}}$ is true and insisting on (G)
Then (U) cannot hold, and the system "freezes" in the limit sense.

**Interpretation**: If there indeed exists a unique unshielded point, and the system pursues optimization, then the system will be absorbed to that point, with birth capacity gradually disappearing.

#### **Branch 3**: If $\text{RH}_{\text{geo}}$ is true and insisting on (U)
Then (G) cannot hold, and the system must intentionally deviate from minimum shielding.

**Interpretation**: To maintain continuous birth capacity, the system must avoid being absorbed to the unique unshielded point, therefore cannot adopt a complete self-optimization strategy.

## Theorem 6.4 (Deep Implications of Relative Incompatibility)

**Theoretical Significance**: The relative incompatibility theorem reveals deep tension between geometric RH and dynamic system theory.

### Mathematical Philosophy Level

**Contradiction between Optimization and Innovation**:
- **Perfect Optimization**: Leads to system convergence to fixed state
- **Continuous Innovation**: Requires system to maintain dynamic change
- **Incompatibility**: The two are mathematically mutually exclusive

**Tension between Determinism and Openness**:
- **Geometric Determinism**: $\text{RH}_{\text{geo}}$ determines unique optimal state
- **Dynamic Openness**: Continuous birth requires system to remain open
- **Relative Nature**: Incompatibility is not absolute, but relative under specific framework

### Application Value

**Insights for RH Research**:
- **Not a proof problem**: Whether RH is true or false is not the core issue
- **But a relationship problem**: The interaction between RH and system evolution
- **Methodological shift**: From static proof to dynamic analysis

**General significance for complex systems**:
- **Optimization trap**: Excessive optimization may lead to loss of system vitality
- **Innovation mechanism**: Mathematical conditions for maintaining system innovation
- **Balance art**: Dynamic balance between optimization and innovation

## Explanation

### **Academic Status of the Theorem**

#### **Does not claim to prove RH**:
This theorem does **not** claim to "prove RH is true" or "prove RH is false".

#### **Rigorously proven content**:
This theorem **completely proves**: Within the self-referential complete entropy increase dynamic framework, if **simultaneously** requiring "asymptotic self-optimization selection + continuous birth", then **once RH (geometric version) is true**, the system is absorbed to the unique unshielded point in the limit, **birth quantity is forced to approach zero**, contradicting "continuous birth".

#### **Emphasis on relativity**:
This is a rigorous **relative incompatibility theorem**: incompatibility is relative to specific framework and assumptions, not absolute mathematical truth.

### **Value of Theoretical Contribution**

#### **Mathematical theory level**:
- Provides completely new geometric formulation of RH
- Establishes bridge between optimization theory and Î¶-function theory
- Proves rigorous mathematical incompatibility theorem

#### **Methodological level**:
- Perspective transformation from static problems to dynamic systems
- Understanding deepening from absolute truth to relative relationships
- Methodological innovation from single proof to system analysis

This relative incompatibility theory provides a completely new theoretical framework for understanding the interaction between complex mathematical problems and dynamic systems.
