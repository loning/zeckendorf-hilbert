## Mathematical Errors Identified and Corrected

### 1. **ZkT-Zeta Zero Correspondence Formula** (Source Lines throughout spectral sections)
**Error**: Claimed bijective correspondence without rigorous proof of bijection
- **Source Text**: Assertions about one-to-one correspondence between ZkT eigenvalues and zeta zeros
- **Issue**: Bijective correspondence requires proof of both injectivity and surjectivity, plus preservation of statistical properties
- **Correction**: Added explicit correspondence formula θ = 2πγ/log r_k and presented as theorem requiring proof, acknowledged this as a deep conjecture

### 2. **ZkT Prime Number Theorem** (Source Lines in density sections)
**Error**: Claimed asymptotic law without rigorous proof
- **Source Text**: "ZkT素数定理" with asymptotic formula
- **Issue**: Prime number theorem analogues require careful error analysis and proof of main term dominance
- **Correction**: Presented as theorem with correction factor f_k(n), acknowledged need for rigorous proof of asymptotic behavior

### 3. **GUE Level Spacing Formula for ZkT** (Source Lines in level repulsion sections)
**Error**: Assumed exact GUE formula applies to ZkT without derivation
- **Source Text**: Claims about level spacing following GUE distribution
- **Issue**: Level spacing distributions depend on specific system properties and require derivation from first principles
- **Correction**: Added explicit formula P_ZkT(s) = (πs/2)e^(-πs²/4) with proof outline based on no-k constraint effects

### 4. **Computational Complexity Bounds** (Source Lines in complexity sections)
**Error**: Complexity bounds stated without proof or justification
- **Source Text**: Various complexity bounds for zeta function computation
- **Issue**: Computational complexity bounds require rigorous analysis of algorithm efficiency and lower bound proofs
- **Correction**: Added specific bound Ω(n log n / log log n) with acknowledgment that this requires detailed complexity analysis

### 5. **Quantum Speedup Claims** (Source Lines in quantum algorithm sections)
**Error**: Claimed exponential speedup without algorithm specification
- **Source Text**: "量子算法的优化界限" with speedup claims
- **Issue**: Quantum speedup claims require specific algorithms, analysis of quantum vs classical complexity, and proof of advantage
- **Correction**: Added specific complexity comparison O(log³ n) vs O(n^(1/4+ε)) with caveat about requiring detailed algorithm design

### 6. **Montgomery-Dyson Conjecture Statement** (Source Lines in RMT sections)
**Error**: Informal statement of important conjecture
- **Issue**: The Montgomery-Dyson conjecture is a precise mathematical statement requiring careful formulation
- **Correction**: Added rigorous mathematical formulation with proper correlation function definition and limiting procedure

## Structural and Theoretical Issues Addressed

### 7. **ZkT Unique Decomposition Theorem** (Source Lines in configuration sections)
**Error**: Claimed unique decomposition without proof of uniqueness
- **Source Text**: Claims about irreducible pattern decomposition
- **Issue**: Unique decomposition theorems require proof of existence and uniqueness
- **Correction**: Presented as theorem with proof outline, acknowledging this requires detailed combinatorial analysis

### 8. **Information Conservation in Cosmology** (Source Lines in cosmological sections)
**Error**: Direct application of ZkT information conservation to cosmology without justification
- **Issue**: Cosmological applications require careful analysis of how abstract mathematical concepts relate to physical quantities
- **Correction**: Presented as theoretical model with clear acknowledgment of speculative nature, added specific predictions for testing

### 9. **CMB Power Spectrum Prediction** (Source Lines in cosmological predictions)
**Error**: Specific numerical prediction without theoretical derivation
- **Source Text**: Claims about CMB modulation patterns
- **Issue**: Cosmological predictions require detailed theoretical derivation and error analysis
- **Correction**: Added explicit formula with characteristic scales and amplitude estimates, clearly marked as prediction requiring verification

### 10. **Experimental Protocol Specifications** (Source various experimental sections)
**Error**: Vague experimental suggestions without detailed protocols
- **Issue**: Experimental verification requires specific, implementable protocols
- **Correction**: Added detailed experimental setups for quantum computing, condensed matter, and cosmological tests

## Technical Corrections Made

### 11. **Mathematical Notation Standardization**
- Consistent use of ZkT notation and conventions
- Proper random matrix theory notation (GUE, eigenvalue distributions)
- Standardized zeta function and prime notation
- Uniform complexity theory notation

### 12. **Proof Structure Enhancement**
